            <h3>Apple</h3>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple
                trees
                are cultivated worldwide
                and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its
                wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in
                Asia
                and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and
                mythological
                significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.

                <p>
                    Malus sieversii is recognized as a major progenitor species to the cultivated apple, and is
                    morphologically similar. Due to the genetic variability in Central Asia, this region is generally
                    considered the center of origin for apples.

                    A raw apple is 86% water and 14% carbohydrates, with negligible content of fat and protein (table).
                    A
                    reference serving of a raw apple with skin weighing 100 grams provides 52 calories and a moderate
                    content of dietary fiber.[70] Otherwise, there is low content of micronutrients, with the Daily
                    Values
                    of all falling below 10%.

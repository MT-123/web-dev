                <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a <a href="somewhere">domestic species</a> of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only
                    domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat or house cat
                    to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] A cat can either be a house cat, a farm
                    cat, or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued
                    by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by
                    various cat registries.[6]

                <h2>Evolution</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that had a common ancestor about 10–15 million
                    years ago.[42] The genus Felis diverged from other Felidae around 6–7 million years ago.[43] Results
                    of phylogenetic research confirm that the wild Felis species evolved through sympatric or parapatric
                    speciation, whereas the domestic cat evolved through artificial selection.[44] The domesticated cat
                    and its closest wild ancestor are diploid and both possess 38 chromosomes[45] and roughly 20,000
                    genes.[46] The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was tamed independently in China around 5500
                    BC. This line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domestic cat populations of
                    today.[47]</p>

                <h2>Behavior</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Outdoor cats are active both day and night, although they tend to be slightly more active at
                    night.[97] Domestic cats spend the majority of their time in the vicinity of their homes but can
                    range many hundreds of meters from this central point. They establish territories that vary
                    considerably in size, in one study ranging from 7 to 28 hectares (17–69 acres).[98] The timing of
                    cats' activity is quite flexible and varied, which means house cats may be more active in the
                    morning and evening, as a response to greater human activity at these times.[99]</p>
